Hardware Based Password Manager
- Key features:
	- Finger print scanner to unlock device
		- Maybe camera and facial recognition?
		- Maybe pin pad thing just in case device fails
	- Generates secure random passwords for individual sites
		- use some analog environmental sensor maybe?
	- Arduino or Qualcomm based hardware that will connect to computer through USB and outputs password
		- Would be cool to automatically outputs password based on current browser URL
		- Easier way would be to select password for site using joystick control
	- Encrypt password on device and backup on cloud or local file

- Optional but cool features:
	- Unlock device through pairing with a personal phone
	- Act as a bluetooth/usb device and work on phones
	- Connect to computer through bluetooth instead of physical USB connection
	- 


Backup ideas:
- Finger printer scanner/facial recognition smart door
	- camera that takes pictures to send to phone to see who's at the door
- Snapchat spectacle type glasses
